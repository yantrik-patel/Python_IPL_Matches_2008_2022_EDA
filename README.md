IPL is the most famous Indian cricket league with players coming from worldwide. What makes this series more competitive every year is the drama with every match. This dataset is a complete dataset showing all matches information. The dataset is availble on Kaggle. We will be analysing top performing teams and also individual players.  


We will be analyzing following scenarios:  

(1) In which year(s), maximum number of matches played?  
(2) Which two teams have the highest winning % and compare them with other top teams.  
(3) Players who have won maximum number of "Player of the match" awards.  
(4) Victory Margin for the teams batting first.  
(5) Teams and Players who have aced while batting first.  
(6) Victory Margin for the teams batting second.  
(7) Teams and Players who have aced while batting second.
